This is a package for easily selecting notes via consult. It's most basic use is
to integrate directories of files (notes) and to provide easy narrowing via
=consult=. But notes can be in principle added from any source that can be
integrated with consult.

=consult-notes= can be used with any directory (or directories) of note files. It
easily integrates with note systems like [[https://github.com/localauthor/zk][zk]] or [[https://github.com/protesilaos/denote][denote]]. It also provides
first-class integration with [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]], where not only files but also org
/headings/ can count as "nodes" or notes.

Consult-notes also provides annotations on note candidates in the minibuffer
(defaults are: directory, file size, last-modified time; denote integration
substitutes keyword for directory; org-roam integration includes tags and number
of backlinks). Consult-notes may be configured to act on selected candidates via
[[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]] (see below). For other customizations please consult the options via =M-x
customize-group consult-notes=.

* Installation
This package is available on MELPA. Or you can install the package from this
repo. Installation with use-package and straight is pretty easy:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package consult-notes
  :straight (:type git :host github :repo "mclear-tools/consult-notes")
  :commands (consult-notes
             consult-notes-search-in-all-notes
             ;; if using org-roam 
             consult-notes-org-roam-find-node
             consult-notes-org-roam-find-node-relation)
  :config
  (setq consult-notes-file-dir-sources '(("Name"  ?key  "path/to/dir"))) ;; Set notes dir(s), see below
  ;; Set org-roam integration OR denote integration, e.g.:
    (when (locate-library "denote")
  (consult-notes-denote-mode)))
#+end_src

* Usage

Set notes directories via =consult-notes-file-dir-sources=. This is a list that
consists of three elements: a title heading, a key (for narrowing), and a
directory path. For example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq consult-notes-file-dir-sources
      '(("Org"             ?o "~/Dropbox/org-files")
        ("Org Refile"      ?r "~/Dropbox/Work/projects/notebook/org-refile")))
#+end_src

=consult-multi= will take each of these sources and present them together in one
integrated consult completion buffer. To narrow to a particular source, use its
designated narrowing key.

*NOTE*: If you don't use any sources beyond that of files in directories, then you
don't need to set anything other than =consult-notes-file-dir-sources=. Org-roam or denote
sources are set by using the relevant minor-mode (see below). However, if you /do/
want to integrate other different kinds of sources (e.g. bookmarks or buffers)
into =consult-notes= then please see the instructions for adding [[https://github.com/minad/consult#multiple-sources][multiple sources
with consult]]. To add an additional non-directory source one should do so by
means of =add-to-list= in one's config, e.g.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'consult-notes
    (add-to-list 'consult-notes-all-sources 'my-notes--additional-source 'append))
#+end_src
  
You may customize narrowing keys, separator names and annotations used. Please
see =customize-group RET 'consult-notes' RET= (or the relevant `.el' files) for
details. The faces used by consult-notes are all similarly customizable.

Though consult-notes by default searches only for names of files (though see the
minor modes for denote and org-roam integration), you may also easily search the
(line) contents of all notes in =consult-notes-all-sources= using the function
=consult-notes-search-in-all-notes=. This uses =consult-grep= or =consult-ripgrep= as
its basis (see the =consult-notes-use-rg= variable). You can set the arguments for
the grep or ripgrep search with the variables =consult-notes-grep-args= and
=consult-notes-ripgrep-args= respectively.

* Denote
[[https://github.com/protesilaos/denote][Denote]] may be used in conjunction with consult-notes in one of two ways. You can
simply set one or more directories containing your denote notes via the
=consult-notes-file-dir-sources= variable as described above, or you can turn on the minor
mode =(=consult-notes-denote-mode)=, which does three things. First, it adds your
=denote-directory= files to =consult-notes-all-sources=. Second, it sets the display of
denote files in consult slightly differently, in the format of =ID Title
#keywords size date modified=. ID, title, and keywords are all searchable. Third,
the minor mode sets the default function when there is no match to create a
denote note. Turning off the minor mode resets the defaults.

* Org-Roam

[[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][Org-roam]] may be used in conjunction with consult-notes but two things should be
kept in mind. First, org-roam works primarily with the concept of a 'node',
which can be /either/ a file /or/ a headline within a file. This means we need to
add org-roam sources differently from that of standard directory sources.
Second, org-roam provides its own completing read interface, which needs to be
integrated with consult-notes.

So, if you want to integrate consult-notes with org-roam, be sure to call the
minor-mode integration via the function =(consult-notes-org-roam-mode)=. This sets
up a minor mode providing some useful functions to integrate search of org-roam
nodes and of org-roam references with the =consult-notes= search and display
functions. It also sets the org-roam display interface to look like that of the
consult-notes interface when used apart from consult (e.g. in calling
=org-roam-node-find=). It adds all your org-roam nodes (whether files or
headlines) to the consult-notes interface (you don't need to do anything
additional for this -- it simply reads off of your org-roam settings), and it
adds your org-roam directory to the list of directories on which
=consult-notes-search-in-all-notes= runs. More functionality may be added in the
future.


* Embark support

If you use [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]] you can integrate consult-notes actions with embark like so: 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun consult-notes-open-dired (cand)
  "Open notes directory dired with point on file CAND."
  (interactive "fNote: ")
  ;; dired-jump is in dired-x.el but is moved to dired in Emacs 28
  (dired-jump nil cand))

(defun consult-notes-marked (cand)
  "Open a notes file CAND in Marked 2.
Marked 2 is a mac app that renders markdown."
  (interactive "fNote: ")
  (call-process-shell-command (format "open -a \"Marked 2\" \"%s\"" (expand-file-name cand))))

(defun consult-notes-grep (cand)
  "Run grep in directory of notes file CAND."
  (interactive "fNote: ")
  (consult-grep (file-name-directory cand)))

(embark-define-keymap consult-notes-map
                      "Keymap for Embark notes actions."
                      :parent embark-file-map
                      ("d" consult-notes-dired)
                      ("g" consult-notes-grep)
                      ("m" consult-notes-marked))

(add-to-list 'embark-keymap-alist `(,consult-notes-category . consult-notes-map))

;; make embark-export use dired for notes
(setf (alist-get consult-notes-category embark-exporters-alist) #'embark-export-dired)
#+end_src

* Citar Support
If you use [[https://github.com/emacs-citar/citar][citar]] you can integrate support with consult-notes and org-roam as follows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Search org-roam notes for citations (depends on citar)
(defun consult-notes-org-roam-cited (reference)
  "Return a list of notes that cite the REFERENCE."
  (interactive (list (citar-select-ref
                      :rebuild-cache current-prefix-arg
                      :filter (citar-has-note))))
  (let* ((ids
          (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from citations
                              :where (= cite-key $s1)]
                             (car reference)))
         (anodes
          (mapcar (lambda (id)
                    (org-roam-node-from-id (car id)))
                  ids))
         (template
          (org-roam-node--process-display-format org-roam-node-display-template))
         (bnodes
          (mapcar (lambda (node)
                    (org-roam-node-read--to-candidate node template)) anodes))
         (node (completing-read
                "Node: "
                (lambda (string pred action)
                  (if (eq action 'metadata)
                      `(metadata
                        ;; get title using annotation function
                        (annotation-function
                         . ,(lambda (title)
                              (funcall org-roam-node-annotation-function
                                       (get-text-property 0 'node title))))
                        (category . org-roam-node))
                    (complete-with-action action bnodes string pred)))))
         (fnode
          (cdr (assoc node bnodes))))
    (if ids
        ;; Open node in other window
        (org-roam-node-open fnode)
      (message "No notes cite this reference."))))
