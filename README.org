This is a package for easily selecting notes via consult. It is largely drawn
from this [[https://github.com/minad/consult/wiki/hrm-notes][wiki entry]] on the consult github page.

NOTE: I have a lot of work to do on this so the package will likely change in
potentially breaking ways, so please update with care!
