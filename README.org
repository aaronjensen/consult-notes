This is a package for easily selecting notes via consult. It is largely drawn
from this [[https://github.com/minad/consult/wiki/hrm-notes][wiki entry]] on the consult github page.

It can be used on its own or in tandem with org-roam (see the minor-mode in
=consult-notes-org-roam.el=. 

Consult-notes applies annotations in the minibuffer via [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][marginalia]] and actions
on candidates via [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]].

NOTE: I have a lot of work to do on this so the package will likely change in
potentially breaking ways, so please update with care!

* Installation
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package consult-notes
  :straight (:type git :host github :repo "mclear-tools/consult-notes")
  :commands (consult-notes
             consult-notes-search-all
             consult-notes-org-roam-find-node
             consult-notes-org-roam-find-node-relation)
  :config
  ;; set org-roam integration
  (consult-notes-org-roam-mode))
#+end_src

* Usage

Set notes directories via =consult-notes-sources-data=. This is a list of a title,
key (for narrowing), and directory path. For example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq consult-notes-sources-data
      '(("Zettel"          ?z "~/Dropbox/Work/projects/notebook/content-org/")
        ("Org"             ?o "~/Dropbox/org-files/")
        ("Lecture Notes"   ?l "~/Dropbox/Work/projects/notebook/content-org/lectures/")
        ("Reference Notes" ?r "~/Dropbox/Work/projects/notebook/content-org/ref-notes/")
        ("Org Refile"      ?R "~/Dropbox/Work/projects/notebook/org-refile/")))
#+end_src

To search all your notes with grep (or ripgrep if installed) you need to either
limit your searches to a single directory, or create a directory containing
aliases of all the files or directories that you have notes in that you'd like
to search. Consult will treat all the aliased files and dirs as if they were all
together in one dir and searches them quickly and easily. Set this via
=consult-notes-all-notes=. 

If you want to use the functions and settings with org-roam be sure to call the
minor-mode integration via =(consult-notes-org-roam-mode)=.
